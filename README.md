AngelOne API https://smartapi.angelbroking.com/

# Working
Just create your Free Account on AngelOne API and using this Tool you will be able to see your Portfolio Performance and your Stock Allocations.

Python Script can be run every 5 Mins which Updates the Data file for react and then ReactJS is used to display the Updated data to the User using ChartJS Visual Charts and Tables

# Future Plans

I am Planning to deploy this project on the Server so that anyone can view my Portfolio Perfomance.
